# Intelligent-Transistor-Analyzer
This project topic is the design and construction of an Intelligent Transistor Analyzer (ITA). This is a project I designed and built for  my Bachelor of Engineering Project Project Thesis in 2002. It's based on the Intel 8051 microcontroller. The ITA uses the phase shift properties of transistors to identify the pins.
An EEPROM programmer is needed to load the machine code to the external EEPROM. In case there is an error in the code, a UV EEPROM Eraser is needed to wipe the ocde and start again. . 
# How to use the code
Download the assembler here: https://plit.de/asem-51/download.htm
Save the Assembly Code:
Save your assembly code with a file extension that is commonly associated with assembly language files. For example, use .asm or .s as the file extension.
assembler_name input_file.asm -o output_file.obj
Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
You'll need to use a terminal or command prompt to interact with the assembler and perform the assembly process. Navigate to the directory where your assembly code is saved.
Check for Errors:
Review the assembler's output for any error messages or warnings. If there are errors, go back to your assembly code and correct them.
Load the Machine Code:
Once the assembly process is successful, you'll have an output file containing the machine code. This machine code can be loaded onto the target microcontroller for execution. The exact method for loading the code onto the microcontroller will depend on the hardware and tools you're using.
Test and Debug:
Test your program on the target hardware and use debugging tools as needed to identify and fix any runtime issues.
Run the Assembler:
Use the command-line interface of your chosen assembler to assemble your code. 
Check for Errors:
Review the assembler's output for any error messages or warnings. If there are errors, go back to your assembly code and correct them.
